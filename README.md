This is a medical service especially designed to manage the activities in the hospital. The new patients can request an appointment with the help of this website in an instant. The website confirms the appointment based on the availability of free slots for the respective doctors and the patient is informed.This application provides a way to record this information and to access these in a simple way. Online Hospital Management Systems enables you to develop your organization and improve its effectiveness and quality of work. Managing the key processes efficiently is critical to the success of the hospital. Since we are entering details of the patients electronically in the Hospital Management System, the data will be secured. Thus, processing information will be faster. It guarantees accurate maintenance of patient’s appointments details.This application also consists a chat bot which will help patient/customer whenever they have any queries. It easily reduces the bookkeeping task and thus reduces the human effort and increases accuracy speed due to this pandemic. It will be easier for the doctors and patients to book the appointment as well as we can read the patient’s review. The website offers many services like Free Checkups, 24/7 Ambulance, Bed Facilities, etc.
The Website and chatbot works best only in pc or desktop screen and if opened on mobile screen the components gets mixed with each other and disrupt the functionality. 





The chatbot tells the users about the details of the hospital, description about diseases and since it is the era of corona it also tells the user about covid-19 and its precautionary measures.


The names used in the contact details provided by the bot are all imaginary and none of those names refer to any real person. Any resemblence of the details with real life people is purely coincidental.


The website also contains links for my instagram, facebook and linkedin profiles. It also contains my contact number and my email-id so if the project invigilator wants to contact me for any reason they can refer to those information.
